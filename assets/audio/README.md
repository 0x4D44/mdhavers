# Audio Assets (Test + Showcase)

These small audio files are generated locally for mdhavers tests and demos:
- `ding.wav`: sine tone generated with ffmpeg.
- `theme.mp3`: sine tone generated with ffmpeg (libmp3lame).
- `wee_tune.mid`: tiny hand-written MIDI sequence.

All files are synthetic and can be treated as CC0/public domain.
