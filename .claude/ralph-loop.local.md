Keep building mdhavers, a complete Scots programming language with file extension .braw. Create the full toolchain — lexer, parser, interpreter, compiler, CLI, documentation, and test suite. Use Scots vocabulary for keywords (like ken, gin, blether, gie) and write error messages in Scots too. Be creative and expand on these ideas — the more Scots flavour the better. This is havers, but it's working havers.
