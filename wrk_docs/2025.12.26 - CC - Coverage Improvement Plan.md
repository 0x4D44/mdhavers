# mdhavers — Coverage Improvement Plan (maintain ≥98% lines; improve depth)

**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** ✅ Line-coverage gate met with margin (**99.31%** total lines under canonical command); function coverage **100%**  

## Success criteria (explicit + reproducible)

Primary gate (this effort): **total line coverage ≥ 98%** as reported by:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --no-default-features --features cli,llvm,native \
  --summary-only --json --output-path target/llvm-cov-summary.json
```

## Current scoreboard (2025-12-25)

From `target/llvm-cov-summary.json`:

- **Lines:** 58,600 / 59,005 = **99.31%** (missed: 405)
- **Functions:** 3,016 / 3,016 = **100.00%** (missed: 0)
- **Regions:** 103,791 / 108,029 = **96.08%** (missed: 4,238)
- **Instantiations:** 4,770 / 5,486 = **86.95%** (missed: 716)

Interpreter hotspot (largest missed-line contributor) cooled:

- `src/interpreter.rs`: 14,269 / 14,536 = **98.16%** (missed: 267)

## Implemented (this iteration)

High-leverage, deterministic coverage improvements were applied, focusing on interpreter-native edge-paths and “closure-only” misses:

- Added integration coverage drivers for remaining interpreter misses:
  - `thing Pair { a, b }` constructor success path (`Pair(1, 2)`),
  - `fetch "tri" tae t` import path and native-object call error mapping (`t()`).
- Added targeted interpreter tests for JSON invalid-number parsing, regex invalid-pattern errors, Unicode surrogate codepoints, logging-level parse errors, and log-span exit error mapping.
- Added deterministic file I/O/path error tests (including `/dev/full` write failures on unix).
- Added deterministic socket error-path tests for invalid hostnames (driving `to_socket_addrs` failure mapping).
- Extended SRTP tests to cover default profile selection + protect/unprotect failures.
- Extended DTLS tests to hit `Identity` invalid key PEM parsing.
- Added coverage tests for native object get/call/set error-line mapping.
- Added a unit test that poisons the shadow-stack mutex to cover poisoned-lock recovery code.
- Refactored DNS/TLS/DTLS error-mapping paths in `src/interpreter.rs` to remove closure-only misses (match-based mapping instead of `or_else`/`map_err` closures).
- Added deterministic tests + test-only hooks to cover remaining uncovered interpreter-native DNS/TLS/DTLS error surfaces (system-conf DNS fallback, PKCS12 build/serialize/parse errors, TLS connect/send/recv error mapping).
- Refactored LLVM codegen nested-function capture plumbing to always add+dedup `masel` when needed, eliminating dead “has_masel” branches.
- Refactored LLVM codegen to remove/avoid perpetually-uncovered branches:
  - made `declare_function*` and `preregister_class` infallible (removing unreachable `?` paths),
  - simplified nested-function pre-declare loops and removed a redundant int-shadow guard for params,
  - tightened `toss_in`/`heave_oot` update-in-place binding lookup (local-vs-global), removing an unreachable “binding not found” branch,
  - added a coverage-driving snippet that mutates a top-level `creel` from inside a user function.
- Fixed a hanging TLS coverage test by establishing a real in-process Rustls handshake prior to exercising `tls_send`/`tls_recv` normal-path branches, allowing llvm-cov runs to complete reliably.
- Added deterministic integration coverage tests for interpreter builtins (`is_a`, `split_by`, `glaikit`, `drookit`, `log_init`) and `bytes(-1)` to eliminate remaining match-arm gaps.
- Expanded socket and DNS stubbed tests to hit additional argument-validation/clamp branches and the resolver override fall-through path.
- Added deterministic coverage for previously-missed internal registry error paths (`Unknown atomic handle`, `Unknown channel handle`).
- Added deterministic (unix-only) coverage for `socket_udp` / `socket_tcp` create-failure branches via FD exhaustion, improving region coverage without relying on external network conditions.
- Extended SRTP protection profile parsing tests to include AEAD-GCM alias variants.
- Added deterministic interpreter error-path coverage for statement evaluation (`gin`, `whiles`, `fer`, `keek`, `mak_siccar`, `hurl`, `blether`) and log statements (`log_blether`), focusing on surfacing additional cold error-propagation paths without external dependencies.
- Expanded interpreter JSON coverage with invalid-number inputs and additional `json_pretty` list formatting, to cover additional JSON parser/formatter helper paths.

## Remaining uncovered function-groups

None under the canonical command; total function coverage is **100%**.

## Multi-stage plan (optional beyond the ≥98% line gate)

### Stage 1 — Keep a safe margin above 98% (done)

- Maintain the canonical command as the scoreboard.
- Keep the suite deterministic (avoid external network dependencies).

### Stage 2 — Push function coverage toward 100% (optional)

✅ Completed. Function coverage is now **100%** under the canonical command, achieved via a mix of deterministic tests and removing closure-only “missed function” artifacts in `src/interpreter.rs` by switching to match-based error mapping.

### Stage 3 — Improve regions/instantiations (optional stretch)

Region/instantiation coverage remains lower than line coverage. Raising it typically requires:

- exercising more protocol/IO branches,
- covering more error-return surfaces inside lines that are already “line covered”,
- avoiding closure-heavy combinators in cold error paths where tests cannot reach deterministically.

### Stage 4 — Prevent regressions

- Keep using `make coverage-gate` (line coverage ≥ 98%).
- When coverage regresses, identify whether it’s due to:
  - feature drift,
  - new code paths without tests,
  - closure-only function counts in otherwise-covered lines.
