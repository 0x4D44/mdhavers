# Journal — Audio Implementation

Date: 2025.12.19

## Entry 1
- Started implementation phase for Scots-only audio support (WAV/MP3/MIDI), independent of graphics.
- Will add `audio` feature, create audio module, remove English audio names, and wire interpreter to register Scots API.
- Need to add MIDI pipeline (midly + rustysynth) and bundle MuseScore General SF2.

## Entry 2
- Added `audio` feature and MIDI deps to `Cargo.toml`; fetched crates (midly, rustysynth).
- Added `src/audio.rs` with Scots-only API, handle management, raylib integration, and MIDI playback via RustySynth.
- Wired interpreter to register audio functions independently of graphics; removed audio stubs from `src/graphics.rs`.

## Entry 3
- Downloaded `MuseScore_General.sf2` and license/readme into `assets/soundfonts/`.
- Added local `assets/soundfonts/README.md` with attribution pointers.

## Entry 4
- Added default soundfont path resolution (cwd/exe-relative) and updated MIDI loader to use it.
- Added README + docs/audio.md updates for Scots-only audio API.

## Entry 5
- Implementation wrapped up; audio module, docs, and assets in place.
- Tests not run yet (raylib build deps may be required).

## Entry 6
- Added test-only audio backend shims and extensive unit tests for audio API.
- Added tiny generated audio assets (wav/mp3/midi) and a new audio showcase demo.
- Removed unused midly dependency from the audio feature.

## Entry 7
- Enabled all features by default (cli, llvm, graphics, audio).

## Entry 8
- Updated README and docs/audio.md to reflect default features now include audio/graphics and how to opt out.

## Entry 9
- Added Ubuntu/WSL raylib build deps (X11 dev packages + cmake) to README and docs/audio.md.

## Entry 10
- Added a troubleshooting section for raylib build errors in README.

## Entry 11
- Added libclang/bindgen troubleshooting notes to README.

## Entry 12
- Added libclang/bindgen troubleshooting notes to docs/audio.md.
