## Cultural Notes

### Robert the Bruce

The assertion keyword `mak_siccar` comes from a famous moment in Scottish history. Robert the Bruce, after the Battle of Bannockburn (1314), reportedly said "Mak siccar" (Make sure) when ensuring an enemy was dead. It's now a phrase meaning "make certain."

### Havers

The name "mdhavers" comes from "havers" - Scots for "nonsense" or "foolish talk." So the language name playfully acknowledges that a programming language with Scots keywords might seem like nonsense, but it actually works!

### Common Scots Expressions

These expressions inform the language's personality:

- **"Braw"** - Good, fine, excellent. The file extension `.braw` reflects this.
- **"Wee"** - Small, little. One of the most iconic Scots words.
- **"Ken"** - To know. "D'ye ken?" = "Do you know?"
- **"Aye"** - Yes (also can mean "always")
- **"Nae"** - No, not
- **"Dinnae"** - Don't. "Dinnae fash yersel" = "Don't worry"

### Pronunciation Guide

Scottish pronunciation differs from standard English:

- **ch** as in "loch" - a guttural sound like German "Bach"
- **wh** often pronounced distinctly - "which" vs "witch"
- **r** is often rolled or trilled
- Long vowels: "guid" (good), "hoose" (house)

### The Scots Language

Scots is not just an accent or dialect - it's a distinct Germanic language closely related to English. It has:

- Its own vocabulary (ken, braw, wee, etc.)
- Different grammar in places
- Regional variations (Doric, Lallans, etc.)
- A rich literary tradition (Robert Burns, Irvine Welsh)

mdhavers uses common Scots words that would be understood across Scotland, avoiding regional variations that might be obscure.
